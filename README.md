# Brick-Breaker 2D

-- Vanilla JavaScript and Canvas game development/DOM manipulation project.

--I built this project in order to practice my vanilla javascript skills, logic skills and to fulfill project requirements for a class project.

--I learned how to better use "class" to reuse elements in my javascript code. I learned how to better manipulate the DOM by creating elements from within the Javascript. I also learned collision, an essential element of game development.

-- Gained a stronger understanding of conditionals being essential essential for conditions to occur in your code, the necessity of Objects in larger scale projects and the interactions between functions and how they can make or break your code.
